## Why axios-last

Once you are seeking for a solution that only take the last value from multiple axios calls, `Rx.js` might be good choice.

What if you don't like `Rx.js`? I am right here!!!

Let's feel how it helps:

<img src={exampleGif} alt="example" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

## Installation

### yarn

```bash
yarn add axios-last
```

### npm

```bash
npm install axios-last
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { create } from 'axios-last'

const request = create()

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  request({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://test.com/users',
    params: {
      name: i
    }
  }).then(res => {
    // only request with name === 2 received
    // all previous requests were cancelled while subsequent made
  })
}
```
